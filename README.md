# data-methodology_resources
This repository is designed to hold resources for structuring machine learning projects, specific to project methodologies and approaches.

1 - ML_Project_Areas_Template Spreadsheet:
This template was inspired by the ("Open Certified Data Scientist Profession (Open CDS)") https://certification.opengroup.org/opencds?_ga=2.13136631.1935910469.1607640501-1710060217.1607640501 - the one and greatly recognized Data Scientist Certification, nationally, in the United States.

It contains the 10 areas any machine learning project should ultimately follow, at the foundational level.  The 10 areas considered to be the "Data Scientist Basic Skills" from "The Open Group Professional Certification Program: Conformance Requirements for Data Scientist Profession (Open CDS).

2 - CRISP-DM Template Spreadsheet: -- The Cross Industry Standard Process of Data Mining
Through my foundational studies of data science offerenced by IBM/Coursera for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (and several other individual resources found along the way) I was able to construct together this template.  If I can share the knowledge I gain along the way I will.  I have more to add to this spreadsheet, so it will be constantly in change (see changes history through time), as I will add more pieces that I've documented in my several notes from this 2020 year of studies. Perhaps later, I will also include some lessons learned through projects practice. Enjoy!
